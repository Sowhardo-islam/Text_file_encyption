# Introducing a New Cryptographic Method

üîê This encryption and decryption system was developed by Sowhardo Islam. It is an innovative cryptographic format designed to secure your sensitive data‚Äîsuch as text files, passwords, phone numbers, PIN codes, and more‚Äîwith robust protection.

‚öí How It Works:

Step 1 = Generate the Format File
Start by running Generate.exe. This program creates a unique format file for securing your data.
‚ùó Do not share the format file with anyone.


Step 2 = Encrypt Your Data
Once the format file is generated in the same directory, run encrypt.exe.
üîπ The terminal will display clear instructions for both encrypting and decrypting your data.{always remove " " in file location before enter}

üîî and [muitimode] needs more processing power and ram use. 

üîî if you have low end pc just use [single mode ]   {recommended}

‚Ñπ  Additional Information
This encryption method is so secure that even the developer, Sowhardo Islam, cannot decode the data without having your generated format file.
For contributors interested in the project, the source code is available for review and further development.
